Development Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of pip-installing the latest release from PyPI_, you should get the
newest development version from Github_::

   git clone https://github.com/sfstoolbox/sfs-python.git
   cd sfs-python
   uv sync

This creates a virtual environment where the latest development version
of the SFS Toolbox is installed.
Note that you can activate this environment from any directory
(e.g. one where you have some Python scripts using the ``sfs`` module),
it doesn't have to be the directory where you cloned the Git repository.

Wherever you activate that environment from,
it will always stay up-to-date, even if you pull new
changes from the Github repository or switch branches.

Building the Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you make changes to the documentation, you can re-create the HTML pages
using Sphinx_.
From the main ``sfs-python`` directory,
you can install it and a few other necessary packages with::

   uv pip install -r doc/requirements.txt

To create the HTML pages, use::

   uv run -m sphinx doc _build

The generated files will be available in the directory ``_build/``.

To create the PDF file, use::

   uv run -m sphinx doc _build -b latex

Afterwards go to the folder ``_build/`` and run LaTeX to create the
PDF file. If you donâ€™t know how to create a PDF file from the LaTeX output, you
should have a look at Latexmk_ (see also this `Latexmk tutorial`_).

It is also possible to automatically check if all links are still valid::

   uv run -m sphinx doc _build -b linkcheck

Running the Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You'll need pytest_ for that.
It can be installed with::

   uv pip install -r tests/requirements.txt

To execute the tests, simply run::

   uv run -m pytest

.. _pytest: https://pytest.org/

Creating a New Release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New releases are made using the following steps:

#. Bump version number in ``sfs/__init__.py``
#. Update ``NEWS.rst``
#. Commit those changes as "Release x.y.z"
#. Create an (annotated) tag with ``git tag -a x.y.z``
#. Clear the ``dist/`` directory
#. Create a source distribution with ``python3 setup.py sdist``
#. Create a wheel distribution with ``python3 setup.py bdist_wheel``
#. Check that both files have the correct content
#. Upload them to PyPI_ with twine_: ``python3 -m twine upload dist/*``
#. Push the commit and the tag to Github and `add release notes`_ containing a
   link to PyPI and the bullet points from ``NEWS.rst``
#. Check that the new release was built correctly on RTD_
   and select the new release as default version
