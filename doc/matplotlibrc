# For some unknown reason, selecting the backend didn't work as written here:
# http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/api/generated/IPython.sphinxext.ipython_directive.html
#
# Neither ipython_mplbackend nor ipython_execlines worked and there was always
# this warning:
#
#   This call to matplotlib.use() has no effect
#   because the backend has already been chosen;
#   matplotlib.use() must be called *before* pylab, matplotlib.pyplot,
#   or matplotlib.backends is imported for the first time.
#
# For some reason, the selected backend was always TkAgg, which didn't work on
# http://readthedocs.org, where the DISPLAY variable was not set.
#
# The only thing that seems to work, is this file.

backend : Agg
